# ASP.NET Core Web API Forgot Password Functionality
  This repository contains a sample ASP.NET Core Web API project that demonstrates the implementation of a Forgot Password functionality. This functionality is crucial for web applications that require users to reset their passwords in case they forget them.
## Features

- Forgot Password Endpoint: Exposes an endpoint to initiate the password reset process by sending a reset link to the user's registered email address.
- Reset Password Endpoint: Allows users to reset their passwords by verifying their identity through a secure token sent to their email.
- Token Generation: Utilizes secure token generation to ensure the reset password process is secure and resistant to attacks.
- Email Integration: Integrates with an SMTP server to send password reset emails to users.
- Secure Practices: Implements industry-standard security practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
## Technologies Used

**ASP.NET Core:** The primary framework for building web applications and APIs.

**C#:** The programming language used for backend logic and API.

**SMTP:** Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for sending emails.

**JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for secure token generation and authentication.

**Swagger UI:** A tool to document and test APIs.

**PostgreSQL:** A lightweight, file-based database used for local development and testing.
